          Hey guys. It&apos;s me, <ManaSymbolSmall src={RG} />
          Red/Green
          <ManaSymbolSmall src={RG} /> I will be your steward to Gruul
          self-discard. Everyone know Gruul dumb, so I keep short:
        </h2>
        <h2>
          I want cards that use discarding and the graveyard to build advantage
          and <i>stay as close to card neutral as possible</i>. I expect red
          looting and green regrowth stocks to the moon.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          If you only make cards with &quot;Discard a card: Do something other
          than get cards&quot;, Gruul is going to be hellbent on turn four.
          Please look out and think about how we reach mid/endgame.
        </h2>

        <h2>
          Basically, these colors (esp. red) already self discard. Focus on
          payoffs and mitigation of impact.

          Black is Gruul&apos;s best friend for graveyard shenanigens, but{" "}
          <Link to="/hellscubes/eight/paradox-incorporated">UR paradox</Link> is
          a cool outlet for madness/impulse/cast from graveyard. White do
          nothing for Gruul.
