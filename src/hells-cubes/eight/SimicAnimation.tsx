        <h1>Simic Animation</h1>
        <div>
          In true Simic fashion, our goal is to take things that unfortunately
          aren’t creatures, and with a little Hellscube magic, turn them into
          lean, mean, game-progress-making creatures! Whether that’s normal
          things like lands and artifacts, or something wacky like your entire
          hand or graveyard, we’ll make it happen! This is an unusual archetype,
          and as such, will probably require some focused effort to really make
          it click. That being said, here are my goals and how I think we can
          bring this archetype to life:
        </div>
        <h2>Creating an Animation Pitch</h2>
        <div>
          First of all, we need ways to animate things. The methods of doing so
          are likely going to vary card by card, but the top minds of Hellscube
          (and me, idk why I was invited) have already come up with a handy
          dandy mechanic to streamline the process:
          <br /> <br />
          <strong>Animate (keyword action):</strong> To animate a target, it
          becomes a creature in addition to its other types, and has power and
          toughness equal to its mana value. (This effect lasts indefinitely.)
          <br /> <br />
          <strong>Animate N (keyword action):</strong> To animate N a target, it
          becomes an N/N creature in addition to its other types. (This effect
          lasts indefinitely.)
          <br /> <br />
          Some example cards with these mechanics are in this thread: ⁠Proposed
          mechanic for UG: Anima…. I imagine animate N will be the more common
          variant, since it’s easier to tune the stats according to the mana
          cost and effect of the card using it. On the other hand, since animate
          (no number afterwards) doesn’t really work on lands and tokens, I
          think it’s probably better used on cards which animate themselves. Of
          course, you don’t have to use this mechanic if it doesn’t fit the card
          you’re making, but if it does, I encourage you to use Animate to
          shortcut the wordy phrasing of animation!
        </div>
        <h2>Assembling an Animation Studio</h2>
        <div>
          Second, and more difficult, are payoffs for animation. These will
          likely be in shorter supply, so I encourage you to make them if you
          have ideas! Of course, controlling more creatures is its own reward,
          but the archetype needs some cohesion to make it work. Some ideas I
          have include:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Payoffs for having several permanent types (something like Superman,
            but in these colors and for types. Or just payoffs for creatures
            with additional card types)
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Payoffs for having animated permanents of specific types (lands and
            artifacts are probably the best candidates for this)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Easy Archetype Pairings</h2>

        <div>Manlands. That is all.</div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Well, I have more to say. But it’s still about manlands. I encourage
          you to lean into the theme of “land creatures!” Make some payoffs for
          land creatures, since they seem like a great fit for HC8 all around.
          Most of the green archetypes are happy with land creatures,
          especially…
        </div>

          <StyledH3>
            <ManaSymbolSmall src={BG} />

        <div>
          You know what’s hard to sacrifice? Lands. You know what’s easy to
          sacrifice? Creatures. You see where I’m going with this. Animating
          lands makes them more likely to die, whether in combat or in an
          unfortunate Deadly Dispute. While that might usually be something to
          tread lightly around, HC8 is fully set up to take advantage of it! BG
          landristocrats turns the risk-reward of land animation into
          reward-reward, so embrace it and let your land animation dreams come
          true!
        </div>
        <h2>TLDR</h2>
        <div>
          Make things that animate. Mostly lands and some artifacts, along with
          other wacky hellsy ideas. But more importantly, start brainstorming
          ideas for animation payoffs.
