          &quot;Historic&quot; is a batching term, which refers to a card or object that is
          legendary, an Artifact, or a Saga. But you already know that. What you don&apos;t know is
          Historic is AWESOME, and the best card ever printed is <i>Jhoira&apos;s Familiar</i>, and
          the best commander ever printed is
          <i>The Sixth Doctor</i>. This also makes this the best archetype in HC8 by default.
        </div>
        <h2>🦉 Designing Historic</h2>
        <div>
          In HC8, what we mean by doing Historic as an archetype is primarily making good Historic
          cards in these types.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          First and foremost,{' '}
          <strong>
            <i>Make good, funny Historic cards in White/Blue</i>
          </strong>
          . In my mind, the ability of these cards to be independent good stuff cards (which then
          get boosted by the occasional card which actually does actively care about them) is what
          comprises Historic as a buildable archetype.{' '}
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Of course, the main part of Historic <i>is</i> the Historic payoff cards, which we&apos;ll
          have to find a balance for as we go through in the design process. The other thing to keep
          in mind with the above is to not try and encroach on the design space of your other
          designers. Get whacky! It helps you stand out. Not too whacky, though, or you&apos;ll be
          shot into the sun.
        </div>
        <h2>🫦 Other things to keep in mind.</h2>
        <div>
          To my friends designing for this archetype, do be careful not to make cards which are too
          generically good, things which any deck would opt to take. This of course goes along with
          trying to find the balance between good fuel and payoff.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          To everyone who&apos;s <i>not</i> designing for this archetype, be careful about making
          Historic permanents, and to my fellow curators please be conscious about the number of
          them among your own archetypes, lest they become too able to be folded within a 3+ color
          Historic draft scenario.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll have more things to say soon. If you want me to weigh in on
          relevant cards feel free to ping me. Seriously, ping me! My warhammer figurines are on the
          other side of the house from my workstation, and my phone pushes ping notifs into my ears.
          It&apos;s the only way I can hear your screams.
