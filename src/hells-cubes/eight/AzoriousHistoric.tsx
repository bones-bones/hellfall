          &quot;Historic&quot; is a batching term, which refers to a card or
          object that is legendary, an Artifact, or a Saga. But you already know
          that. What you don&apos;t know is Historic is AWESOME, and the best
          card ever printed is <i>Jhoira&apos;s Familiar</i>, and the best
          commander ever printed is
          <i>The Sixth Doctor</i>. This also makes this the best archetype in
          HC8 by default.
        </div>
        <h2>ðŸ¦‰ Designing Historic</h2>
        <div>
          In HC8, what we mean by doing Historic as an archetype is primarily
          making good Historic cards in these types.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          First and foremost,{" "}
          <strong>
            <i>Make good, funny Historic cards in White/Blue</i>
          </strong>
          . In my mind, the ability of these cards to be independent good stuff
          cards (which then get boosted by the occasional card which actually
          does actively care about them) is what comprises Historic as a
          buildable archetype.{" "}
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Of course, the main part of Historic <i>is</i> the Historic payoff
          cards, which we&apos;ll have to find a balance for as we go through in
          the design process. The other thing to keep in mind with the above is
          to not try and encroach on the design space of your other designers.
          Get whacky! It helps you stand out. Not too whacky, though, or
          you&apos;ll be shot into the sun.
        </div>
        <h2>ðŸ«¦ Other things to keep in mind.</h2>
        <div>
          To my friends designing for this archetype, do be careful not to make
          cards which are too generically good, things which any deck would opt
          to take. This of course goes along with trying to find the balance
          between good fuel and payoff.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          To everyone who&apos;s <i>not</i> designing for this archetype, be
          careful about making Historic permanents, and to my fellow curators
          please be conscious about the number of them among your own
          archetypes, lest they become too able to be folded within a 3+ color
          Historic draft scenario.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll have more things to say soon. If you want me
          to weigh in on relevant cards feel free to ping me. Seriously, ping
          me! My warhammer figurines are on the other side of the house from my
          workstation, and my phone pushes ping notifs into my ears. It&apos;s
          the only way I can hear your screams.
