        <h1>Lands.</h1>
        <div>
          We love &apos;em. We need &apos;em. But none of the other folks
          undertand &apos;em like we do. <ManaSymbolSmall src={GW} />
          gamers- the God-fearing folk who live off the lands, who feel them
          underneath our toes and who connect with their utility.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Some red deck gamer is going to play 17 basic mountains, a few hasty
          creatures and flashback a burn spell or two. Us? We cram every single
          bit of utility, win-con, value engine and other sub-par non-basic we
          can into the bad boy. If our lands are coming in untapped, it meant we
          jumped through more hoops than you&apos;ll find at a gym session for
          40-something white women. It meant we worked for it.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          Tempo? You have the gall to talk to me about tempo?! Your filthy basic
          island is not going to tap for shit when your hand is empty. I&apos;ll
          be proliferating, populating, and animating all the way to the bank
          when your oh-so-swanky engine putters out on turn 9. We spit on tempo.
          A game of magic is going to take a maximum of 30-something turns, give
          or take. If your utility land comes online on turn 5, that&apos;s 25
          turns of free value for you. Delicious, delicious value. I&apos;d like
          to see your 15 swamps do that, nerd.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          But we&apos;re not just activating our lands. Our sisters over in{" "}

          have the right of it that lands should go in the graveyard- but why
          stop there? Why not lands with suspend hopping into exile? Lands in
          hands being beheld for extra effects, lands going into and on top of
          libraries, and then being milled into the graveyard. If our lands
          aren&apos;t going on a merry jig through every zone in the game, why
          even bother?

        <div>
          Now, with all this, you might still be thinking; &quot;But Pax,
          where&apos;s our playables? If we&apos;re drafting 17 nonbasics, how
          do we fill out the rest of the deck?!&quot; First of all, screw you
          for using my real name, that&apos;s Commisar Curator to you. Second;
          when you draft Lands, your lands are your playables. Plus, with a mana
          base the size of Boston, splash away!

          And you know what? For you fuckers, I&apos;ll even throw in some Land
          design tips for the low low price of free:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don&apos;t make something that&apos;s just better than a basic land.
            Give it a downside. Tapped entering and life are classics, but get
            jiggy with it.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Don&apos;t make all the lands colorless. The lands are ours. If I
            see one filthy{" "}
            <Link to="/hellscubes/eight/paradox-incorporated">
              Paradox <img height="12px" src={UR} /> gamer
            </Link>{" "}
            playing with our utillity lands, I&apos;m going to be knocking in
            skulls.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Make the supporting cast too. What&apos;s a Reliquary Tower without
            its Knight of The Reliquary? What- those cards have little to no
            inherent synergy? Well make some that do! Cards that care about
            lands in zones or activated abilities of lands are obvious, but the
            ol&apos; exploration mappy tutors are also swell. Get creative-
            that&apos;s your job, not mine.
