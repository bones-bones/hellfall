        <h5>hi friends. i&apos;m the curator for small reanimation :)</h5>
        <div>
          This is my favorite strategy in all of magic so i&apos;m excited to
          help create it with y&apos;all! For this archetype to be successful we
          are gonna want a couple different types of cards:
        </div>
        <br />
        <h6>1. small reanimation</h6>
        <div>
          anything that brings back little creatures, this will be the backbone
          of the deck. unearth and seine&apos;s reclamation are good examples of
          this, and so is lurrus of the dream den.
        </div>
        <h6>2. little creatures.</h6>
        <div>
          obviously we will need stuff to reanimate! anything that cares about
          dying or coming back will be a great fit for this archetype, this is
          also an aggressive archetype so it helps if they are on rate bodies.
          eg archfiend&apos;s vessel, doomed traveler, or selfless spirit
        </div>
        <h6>3. ways to put stuff into the yard</h6>
        <div>
          obviously dying in combat is a major way to put stuff in your
          graveyard but sac outlets and self mill is also a useful thing for us.
          cards like carrion feeder, deadly dispute, or cards with dredge are
          great.
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>
          It&apos;s also important to note that this will be a slower archetype
          that will need to collect cards from each of those categories to win.
          This might be through a literal game winning combo or via powerful
          synergy (thank you to Red for the idea to include this part)
        </div>
        <br />
        <div>â€”8ofswords</div>
      </BigContainer>
    </>
  );
};
