        <div>
          You know &apos;em, you love &apos;em, and now it&apos;s time to commit
          as many of them as possible. In the case that you don&apos;t know what
          a crime is, the first card I clicked on in Scryfall defines a crime as{" "}
          <i>
            (Targeting opponents, anything they control, and/or cards in their
            graveyards is a crime.)
          </i>
          .
        </div>
        <br />
        <Divider color={RB} />
        <h2>The Crimes Themselves</h2>
        <div>
          A lot of accidental crimes tend to creep into card design. Targeted
          removal, targeted graveyard removal, targeted burn, nasty unpleasant
          evil auras and curses, you know the sort. What we need now is very
          intentional crimes. Ping a single opponent instead of each opponent,
          picking off graveyard cards one at a time instead of bojuka bogs, that
          sort of stuff. This is the category of cards that I think I have the
          least concern about, given that the average cube is full of this kind
          of stuff anyway, so just do your best and have fun.
        </div>
        <br />
        <Divider color={RB} />
        <h2>Crime Payoffs</h2>
        <div>
          Now this is where I have a bit of concern. Making the crimes
          themselves is easy enough, profiting off of them is something that
          we&apos;re going to have to remember to do. SO, things that care about
          targeting your opponents stuff. OTJ, being the set with crimes, had a
          few of these, and feel free to have a look around. Just make sure to
          make these, alright? I don&apos;t have much else to say in this
          category.

          Our wonderful compatriots in mardu touching. This wonderful
          partnership shall result in many indicate jokes. Although please
          don&apos;t step on the toes of orzhov when making them. In addition to
          this, there&apos;s a cool but small subset of auras that scryfall
          calls &quot;Conditional Auras&quot;.{" "}
          <a href="https://tagger.scryfall.com/tags/card/conditional-aura">
            These things.
          </a>{" "}
          Anyway, if you can think of fun jokes to do with these they would be
          cool, given that they work with boros targeting as they boost your own
          stuff, and rakdos crimes, since they hurt your opponents stuff.

          You know what&apos;s better than cards you can cast to commit crimes?
          Cards you can discard or cast to commit crimes. Madness, Channel, you
          know the sort. Make a few of these with burn or stuff, to give
          everythingslinger a few more options for shooting people and to give
          us even more lovely lovely crimes

          yeah im not going to beat around the bush and be fancy here since this
          one&apos;s a stretch, but once again, crimes that benefit other
          archetypes, foretelling crimes and flashbacking crimes and all other
          kinds of posthumous crimes.
