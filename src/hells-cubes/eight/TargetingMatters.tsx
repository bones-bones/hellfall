      <h1>RW Targetting Matters</h1>
      <div>
        If you&apos;ve played any amount of Magic between MH3 and a couple of
        days ago, you might want to throttle me to death for this one, but thog
        dont caare. You&apos;re getting Targeting Matters whether you like it or
        not. (Also known as Heroic/Valiant/That Horseshit Nadu Was Doing For A
        While).
      </div>
      <br />
      <Divider color={rw} />
      <h2>Things That Target</h2>
      <div>
        This happens a lot anyway. Equipments, Auras, Dilu Horses and Giant
        Growths just to name a few. But, in order to make them not be dead cards
        so much, make sure to give them a little something for your trouble.
        Maybe a tapped Treasure, or a Cycling effect, or even some card draw
        (such as with Defiant Strike). You could even change your potential buff
        spells into Overload spells. Just some food for thought.
      </div>
      <br />
      <Divider color={rw} />
      <h2>Things That Get Targetted</h2>
      <div>
        This is the part that is less automatic. You gotta include payoffs for
        being targetted. This can be something literal like &quot;When this
        creature is targetted, get X.&quot;, it could be something mostly
        related to the concept (such as Zada, Hedron Grinder&apos;s ability) or
        it could even just be something you&apos;d want to target (I&apos;ll get
        to that). You could even make Indicate hand tokens. Please do that.

        This, I feel, is quite obvious. There&apos;s not much of a leap between
        targetting your own stuff and targetting your opponent&apos;s stuff. I
        like the idea of Conditional Auras that MumkeGutz brought up, but
        another thing you could do is make a guy who turns targets into crimes.
        You&apos;ll figure it out, I&apos;m sure.

        Ever noticed what the second word in Reanimate is? Checkmate atheists.
        For real though, I&apos;m sure there will be plenty of good creatures to
        target in these colours, especially since Dimir is all about evasive
        creatures.

        Equipments are historic. Little bit thin, but it&apos;s something.

        I&apos;m sure you can staple some targetted effects onto Channel
        abilities, or heck, you could even add Cycling to some of the target
        effects.
